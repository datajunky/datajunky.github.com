## What is this about?

The Data Junkies is a blog showcasing twice a week companies crazy
about data.

## What for?
I'm really interested in data, and working on something related with
it but I just can't know easily which companies are solving data
related problems or have data scientists positions available.

_The Data Junkies_ wants to increase visibility of companies working
with data and help anyone interested in data science to know more
companies working on this field.


## Can I pay to get my company featured here?
No. Being featured is totally free but due to the high demand you will
have to wait some days to get to the front page.

If you are interested in being featured send us an email to info@thedatajunkies.com.

## I'm a Data Scientists, Can I get featured here too?
Sure, I would like to let other people meet other data scientists and
know what they are doing.
